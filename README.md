# Data Structure

### About this repository

Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to [William Fiset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&t=5493s). It is exactly through watching his videos that I have learned so much about the Data Structure. This repository will store course notes and code on Data Structure and all code will be written in the C language.

Secondly, in this repository, I plan to create straightforward tutorials that will aid other beginners in comprehending the content. However, I believe that completing this task will require some time and effort.

Finally, if you have any questions, please feel free to let me know. I will do my best to assist you. Similarly, if you would like to correct any mistakes I make, you are also welcome to pull requests.
